# Blog-Application

 blog application that supports adding and searching blog posts. 
 Start by setting up a page (like /blog) where you maintain state using React hooks to manage the list of blog posts. 
 Create a form component that allows users to add new blog entries by providing a title, author, category, excerpt, and content. 
 Each submission updates the blog post list, which is rendered dynamically. 
 Additionally, include a search input field where users can type keywords to filter posts by title or content in real time.
